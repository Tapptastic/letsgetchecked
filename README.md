# LetsGetChecked Test

As mentioned if you do "npm run start" this will serve json-server on 9001 and will then compile the Angular app.

## Included 

This meets everything that you detailed in your list under "Business requirements" & "Angular requirements". There are a couple of things that I wanted to put in here that I didn't have time

- Way to comment on Sub Comments would of been great. I would of had it either, that each comment you selected would of then bought up the comment component. Or I would of had that, you could of selected a comment and the commnetId to be stored and then passed as the parentId when sent to the server.
- I would of liked to make it more colourful and playful. There is a small animation when you hold _"left click"_ on a blog post. I would of liked to add more animation/transition as well.
- Also you can see that the method used to do Parent-Child hierarchical structure is O(n2), it would of been great to see if I could of used a different data structure have better performance.

Looking forward to hearing from you and any feedback is greatly appreciated! My background is primarly React so I was learning/re-learning Angular while doing this test. So apolgises if the structure is a little unorthodox.

If there are any issues please let me know.
