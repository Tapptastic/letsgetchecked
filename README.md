# LetsGetChecked Test

As mentioned if you do "npm run start" this will serve json-server on 9001 and will then compile the Angular app.

## Included 

This meets everything that you detailed in your list under "Business requirements" & "Angular requirements". There are a couple of things that I wanted to put in here that I didn't have time

- Way to comment on Sub Comments would of been great. I would of had it either that each comment you selected would of then bought up the comment component, or I would of had that you could of selected a comment and the commnetId to be stored and then passed as the parentId when sent to the server.
- I would of liked to make it more colourful and playful. There is a small animation when you hold "left click" on a blog post. I would of liked to add more animation/transition as well.


If there are any issues please let me know.
